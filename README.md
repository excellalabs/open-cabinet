## Concept
OpenCabinet is a tool for the public to find interactions between the medicine
that they and their family are taking using data directly from the FDA.

## Approach 

**Excella Consulting** followed an agile development framework to build
**OpenCabinet** in an iterative, incremental manner.  The cross-functional team,
comprised of analysts, designers, and developers, began with Sprint 0, followed
by two-day sprints. The team met for a daily stand-up and ended with a quick
review and retrospective.

The team consisted of the following: 

* Product Manager
* Technical Architect
* User Researcher/Usability Tester
* Writer/Content Designer
* Visual Designer
* Front-End Web Developers
* Back-End Web Developers
* DevOps Engineer
* Business Analyst


The self-organized team not only fulfilled their individual roles in the design
and development process, but also helped where needed to deliver a quality
product. The Product Manager led the effort with a focus on the value delivered
by the final product, enabling the team to respond quickly to changing
priorities and address feedback from **[usability
testing](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/tree/master/documents/design/usability_testing)**.
Utilizing **[GitHub issues](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/issues)**,
the team created and groomed a
[backlog](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22user+story%22+),
discussed [design
decisions](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+label%3Adesign+),
and tracked
[bugs](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+label%3Abug+).

---
## Sprint 0
First, the team used an internal Slack channel to
**[crowdsource](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/images/crowdsourcing.png)**
ideas for the application using [OpenFDA's Label
API](https://open.fda.gov/drug/label/). Then, the team reviewed the suggestions
and discussed the feasibility of delivering a product in the given timeframe.
Weighing both the design and development perspectives, the team converged on
"[my medicine
cabinet](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/design/brainstorming.md)"
to allow customers to view all of their family's medications in one place and
understand the risks and side effects.

During Sprint 0, the team accomplished four objectives:
 
* Explored users’ **needs and reactions**
* Determined the **application's value**
* Decided what **technologies** to use
* Established the **development environment**

###Needs and Reactions
The User Researcher interviewed potential users to understand their needs. This
research unveiled that users’ primary goal was to determine medical
interactions, which caused the Product Manager to modify the initial concept to
focus on this feature. The Content Designer created
**[Personas](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/design/personas.md)**
to represent different user types, and included one in the **[Short-Form
Creative
Brief](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/design/short_form_creative_brief.md)**,
which was read aloud each morning in stand-up. These tools informed the design
and features included in the **[Minimum Viable
Product](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Amvp)**
(MVP).

###Application's Value
The Business Analyst performed a **[Competitive
Analysis](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/design/competitive_analysis.md)**,
which revealed that many applications show medical interactions. The team
decided they could differentiate themselves by designing and building an
application that was simple, easy to use, and incorporated a pleasant user
experience. A roadmap for future enhancements, indicated in the **[Product
Tree](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/design/product_tree.md)**,
will further distinguish OpenCabinet from the current marketplace.


###Technologies
The Technical Architect, Front-End, and Back-End Developers collaborated,
researched, and evaluated tools to determine the best technologies to develop
the prototype. With a focus on open source, rapid prototyping, and code quality,
the team chose **Ruby on Rails** as the application framework. 

###Development Environment

With the core technology agreed upon, the DevOps Engineer set up a development
environment leveraging **Docker**, **Vagrant** and **Chef**. By virtualizing the
operating system and providing a **[living set of installation
instructions](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/technical/installation.md)**,
team members quickly got their environments up in a consistent manner with a
prescribed set of required infrastructure. Combined with **GitHub’s version
control**, the team set the base for intuitive versioning and consistent
baselines for development. The team built a continuous integration and delivery
pipeline to deploy a skeleton Rails application, which was deployed onto the
PaaS provider, **Heroku**, to allow for scalability. Through the use of
**Travis**, the chosen continuous integration server, code was [continuously
deployed](https://travis-ci.org/excellaco/open-cabinet) after passing a series
of quality assurance checks.

Against every pull request and push to the master branch, Travis automatically
ran:

* **RSpec** for unit and integration tests
* **Cucumber/Capybara** for automated acceptance tests
* **Teaspoon/Mocha** for testing JavaScript
* **Rubocop** for static code analysis
* **Brakeman/Code Climate** for security static analysis
* **Code Climate** for code quality metrics
* **SauceLabs** for multiple browser testing


**Travis** was also tightly integrated with GitHub. Utilizing Travis, code
reviewers assessed the status of pull request
[tests](https://travis-ci.org/excellaco/open-cabinet) to ensure that along with
a visual inspection of the code, all tests also passed. These tests and code
reviews were incorporated into the team's **[Definition of
Done](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/images/definition-of-done.jpg)**
to demonstrate that functional code was being deployed to production and that it
provided added value to the product.

 ![build-pipeline-1](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/images/build_pipeline_v3.png)


The final integration points secured the application and brought visibility to
the health of the application. **TLS certificates** were acquired and set up to
ensure user security.
**[Slack](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/images/slack-integrations.png)**,
which served as the team’s collaboration forum, was configured to automatically
notify the team of changes to the repository, and denoted key checkpoints in the
continuous integration process.  The GitHub repository housed **Badges**, which
provided visibility to the code’s [test
coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/excellaco/open-cabinet/coverage),
[quality](https://codeclimate.com/github/excellaco/open-cabinet/code), and
[build status](https://travis-ci.org/excellaco/open-cabinet/builds). Monitoring
tools, **New Relic**, **Log Entries**, **Google Analytics**, and **Air Brake**,
captured and alerted key metrics and issues with the system.


The Front-End Web Developers established a lightweight framework that supported
OpenCabinet's design patterns and **[Style
Guide](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/design/style_guide.md)**,
and implemented tools that created structure, but were flexible to meet
mobile-responsive design needs.

* For presentation, **Sass**, **Bourbon**, and **Neat** were used to lay the
  foundation
* For interaction, **T3** was used as the JavaScript framework, and
  **Teaspoon/Mocha** was used for testing JavaScript code
* For post processing,
  **[SauceLabs](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/images/sauce-labs.png)**
  ran acceptance tests against various browsers and **AutoPrefixer** ensured
  that vendor prefixes were added to CSS to do the same
* For usability testing, **Flip** implemented feature toggling to support A/B
  testing

## Sprint 1 + 2

### Design
Sprint 1 resulted in two artifacts created by the Visual Designer: 


* A **Style Guide** ensuring visual consistency by providing guidance on how to
  use typography, color, and address visual elements.   
* Initial **[prototype
  mock-ups](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/design/design_concept_1.md)**
  for two different layouts. During usability testing,
  [users](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/design/round_1_testing.md)
  unanimously preferred the “cabinet” option. This design is represented in the
* desktop and mobile versions of the final prototype.


During Sprint 2, user feedback was incorporated into a [second version of
mock-ups](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/design/design_concept_2.md).
The Usability Tester performed additional usability tests, which revealed that
certain key elements (e.g. navigation and search) were [not well
received](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/design/round_2_testing.md).
The team created issues in GitHub addressing these pain points. The iterative
development approach allowed developers to easily make changes to the
application, even when subsequent rounds of usability testing demanded
additional design changes.


### Development
During Sprints 1 and 2, the development team developed the foundation of the
application. Following a strategy of short-lived branches and continuous
integration of small features into the master branch, the team began initial
implementation of the API integrations. Caching was implemeted in order to keep
API requests performant and limit requests. This set the framework to get
features out quickly for usability testing when the designs were complete, which
ultimately allowed for constant feedback and improvements of the product.


---

## Sprint 3 + 4  

### Design
The team completed the MVP in Sprints 3 and 4, and began performing usability
testing on a functioning application.  With the new interactions in place, the
team discovered that users were confused by how medicine selection worked. The
interaction visualizations were then re-evaluated and the team created
alternative options to test with users through a [feature
toggle](https://opencabi.net/features).

![review-process](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/blob/master/documents/images/design_process.png)

By initially conducting usability testing with paper prototypes, the team
learned what customers wanted early in the process, before investing time on
development. From each round of testing, the Usability Tester discovered key
insights that drove the next round of designs and development.

Following these human-centered design techniques ensured that:

* Design was based on an explicit understanding of users, obtained from
  crowdsourcing and user research.
* Users were involved throughout the design and development process, by allowing
  them to inform OpenCabinet's purpose, give feedback on design mock-ups, and
  interact with each version of the application.
* Design was driven and refined by user-centered evaluation through multiple
  rounds of usability testing.
* The process was iterative, with user feedback driving the next round of design
  and development activities.



### Development
By using the **Definition of Done** created in Sprint 0, the team prioritized
code quality by including
[unit](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/tree/master/spec),
[integration](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/tree/master/spec), and
[acceptance
tests](https://github.com/excellaco/open-cabinet/tree/master/features), and
performing a code review before it was merged into master. These practices
ensured that the application was stable for usability testing and allowed for
constant refactoring and improvement of the code base without the fear of
breaking core functionality. Even in a dynamic and fast-paced environment, the
development team reacted to user feedback and implemented feature toggles, which
allowed for re-mixing various views of the data to support further usability
testing.


**`... and ended with "Ship It"`**
